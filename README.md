# Garden DNA — Personalized Financial Ecosystem

---

## Overview

**Garden DNA** is an innovative web application that visualizes your personal financial identity as a living, evolving garden. Instead of static numbers and boring reports, your income, expenses, savings, and financial habits are represented as trees, flowers, vines, and weather that grow, bloom, or wither in response to your financial behavior and life changes.

This dynamic garden metaphor makes personal finance intuitive, emotionally resonant, and engaging — helping you nurture a healthier, flourishing financial future.
